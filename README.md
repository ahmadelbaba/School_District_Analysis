# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview:
#### The school board has notified us that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. To uphold state-testing standardswe are asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After repalcing the math and reading scores, we repeat the school district analysis and discuss how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results:
### How is the district summary affected?
#### Average math and reading scores haven't really changed. Passing math, reading and overall passinig % have dropped a bit.
